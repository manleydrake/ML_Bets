# Sports Analysis Application  
The purpose of this application is to implement a machine learning algorithm that applies predictive analysis to determine which team is most likely to win. This will help users decide which team is most beneficial to place bets on.


## About 


### Functionality 
* Predictive Analysis
    * Who's going to win
    * Potential margin of victory
* Give game insight
    * Key matchups
    * Previous game statistics
    * Any player/injury updates that would affect game

### Tools and Technology
* Visual Studio 
* Visual Studio Code 
* Git 
* Python 
* SQL 
* C#
* React.js 
* Bootstrap/Semantic UI Framework 
* Azure/AWS
## High Level Steps for Development 
1. Scrape NBA Stats using Python Script
* Creating API Calls from [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/) 
* Clean data 
* Creating/Updating Database 
* Error Handling  
* Testing (Load, Scalability)

2. ML Analysis 
* Machine learning model implemented 
* Attributes required
* Error Handling 
* Decide what Variables we are going to predict 
* Analysis storage location ?
* Testing (Regression, Unit, Load, Scalability)

3. Build Web API 
* ASP.Net MVC API endpoints 
* Error Handling 
* Testing (Automation, Speed, Postman)
4. Front End Development 
* TBD (Page Layout, Page Numbers, etc.)
* UAT Testing 
    * Testers ?
    * 5-6 Users play with user interface and see functionality     
5. Security 
* SSO Implementation
